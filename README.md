## **_Introducing, Arnold_**
  Hi, my name is _Arnold Melnikov_ and I will be introducing myself.
  I have no idea from what town I come from but I am aware that I attend at
[A.Y. Jackson Secondary School](https://ayjacksonss.ocdsb.ca/Pages/home.aspx). 
I have a Russian family, no brothers, no sisters, just me. My dad is _Alexandre Melnikov_ and my mom is _Natalia Baranova_, they went through separation and my dad is now re-married and my mom is with someone else. 
I have a few hobbies, I play **video games** on my free time when I have nothing to do, I played two **instruments** and I still play one of them. I played the _trumpet_ till' level six and I started playing the _guitar_ almost a year ago. I can listen to what other people listen to, but I prefer the song, **_Ocean Man_** by **_Ween_** but, although that's my favourite song, my favourite genre is _Synthwave_.
My favourite movie **has** to be **_The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_** and my favourite actor **has** to be **_Arnold Schwarzenegger_**. I have many favourite foods, but mostly they're Japanese, and my favourite Japanese food is the _Shrimp Tempura_. I don't have many reasons except that I **absolutely love** when it's deep fried and it's _amazing_ taste.
At the moment, I have no jobs.
I consider myself very _active_ and _sporty_. I also consider myself _musicaly talented_, but then I have some flaws, like, I'm _not the best_ when it comes to _math_ and _geography_.
I can speak _three languages_, **_Russian_**, **_English_** and **_French_**.<img src="https://media.gq.com/photos/586d6016b730b94511591f33/master/w_3000/james-harden.jpg">I think this image represents me because I love sports(i.e. Basketball) and I'm not a very sad person.
During the weekend I usually go to _sleepovers_ or I just binge watch my favourite shows on _Netflix_. 
I don't like the kind of **jokes** that are like, "why did the chicken cross the road?", because I don't find those **funny**. I want to get the whole business experience with business technologie class. I want to know how it's like being a businessman and how programming websites system works. What I'm saying is, that I want to see the full picture. I have used only **two softwares** in my life, **_Windows_** and **_MacOS_**, unless **_Playsation_** counts, then it's two. I think I have nothing to add, except that _I'm am very interested in this class_ and I want to **learn** more about it.
